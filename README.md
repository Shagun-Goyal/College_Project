# 🌐 ICAICCIT 2025 Website 
# (Clone + Custom Build)

This is a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of the official ICAICCIT 2025 conference website, recreated in my own style with improvements.
The project demonstrates building a responsive, interactive, and modern conference landing page without using any frameworks.

# 🚀 Features
Custom Homepage Design with hero section, conference details, theme, and date.
Animated Typing Effect for conference title and theme.
Partner Logos Section with hover effects (logos highlight with white background on hover).
Footer with Contact Info styled in a single line with smaller text.
Responsive Navbar linking to internal sections & other pages (About, Committee, Registration, Contact).
Vanilla JS Animations for smooth transitions.
Planned Enhancements: Scroll animations, parallax effects, mobile-first optimizations.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

CSS3 for styling & responsiveness
JavaScript (Vanilla JS) for interactivity and animations
